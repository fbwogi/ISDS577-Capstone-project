Abstract
Given the mounting concerns surrounding housing affordability and the evolving landscape of real estate markets in recent years, it is only fitting that our capstone project centers around this pivotal topic. We aim to dive deep into the factors influencing real estate prices, explicitly focusing on the interplay between federal interest rates, property amenities, and proximity to essential amenities.
Our data compilation process will draw from various reputable sources, including government databases and prominent platforms like Zillow and Redfin. To analyze this wealth of data, our methodology will incorporate advanced statistical techniques, spanning from multiple linear regression to time series forecasting and a spectrum of machine learning algorithms.
The overarching goal of this project is twofold: firstly, to pinpoint significant predictors of housing prices, and secondly, to provide actionable insights tailored for stakeholders within the real estate realm. Through our comprehensive analysis, we aspire to equip decision-makers with the knowledge necessary to formulate informed strategies and policies, thus effectively tackling the pressing challenges in today's housing market.
